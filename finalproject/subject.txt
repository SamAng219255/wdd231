Subject:
	Pathfinder (A table-top roleplaying game that branched off of Dungeons and Dragons)
Description:
	The site will have 3 pages.
	The main page will contain a description of the game and list of resources.
	There will also be a page to post groups to play together or to join those groups. (This may be divided into multiple pages to accommodate the forms and list.)
	The last page will include a digital dice roller for rolling groups of dice with static modifiers. Previous rolls, with their results, as well as favorites and the current settings, will be stored in local storage.
Reason:
	I play Pathfinder often and have found that these are commonly useful assets.
